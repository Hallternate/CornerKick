# CornerKick

A web app for keeping track of different events and schedules across different leagues. If you wanted to create this for youself you could use this code and set up a firebase realtime database. Once set up you would grab your key and add it to a .env then package and run this statically. You could then enter in your events times and dates and share the link with anybody else you wanted to have access.
